### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert indicates unauthorized group changes, which could indicate privilege escalation or lateral movement. Given the MITRE IDs, itâ€™s likely part of a broader account manipulation campaign.
2.  **User Attribution Strategy:** Since the alert mentions a specific username ('jdoe'), start with a direct check in the organization database. If no recent changes are found, expand the time window slightly.
3.  **Process Behavior Strategy:** For the Velociraptor queries, focus on the parent process of the `net.exe` command used to modify groups. Look for suspicious child processes or network activity.
4.  **Host Vulnerability Strategy:** Scan the host for known vulnerabilities related to group manipulation or privilege escalation.
5.  **Contextual Guidance Strategy:** Consult internal documentation and past incident reports to understand typical group management workflows and identify potential false positives.
