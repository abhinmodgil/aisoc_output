### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt via group modification. The subject user ('anika.sharma') appears to be internal, but the exact nature of their role isn't clear yet.
2.  **Strategy for Organization Database Queries:** Since we don't know much about the user beyond their username, a lookup in our HR/Employee database is essential to gather basic details like job title, department, and hire date.
3.  **Strategy for Wazuh Queries:** Given the severity of the alert, it's crucial to check if this user has triggered similar alerts in the past. Additionally, looking for any existing vulnerabilities on the host can help determine whether exploitation was possible.
4.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Queries:** We need to reconstruct the sequence of events leading up to the group modification. This includes finding the parent process of 'net.exe' and examining its child processes, network activity, and file system interactions.
