### Executive Summary
This alert represents a legitimate administrative change to domain policies, likely part of routine maintenance or configuration updates. While the specific details are unclear due to insufficient contextual information, the absence of any other indicators of compromise suggests this is a non-malicious operation.

### Final Verdict
**Benign**

### Confidence
**Very Low**

### Justification
The final risk score of 0 indicates no immediate concern. The "User Attribution" and "Process Behavior" dimensions both scored 0, meaning there is no clear indication of who made the changes or what processes were involved. Additionally, the "Host Vulnerability" and "Contextual Guidance" dimensions also scored 0, suggesting no known vulnerabilities were exploited and no additional context exists to explain the behavior. Given these factors, the lack of any other suspicious activity or indicators leads us to conclude this is a benign administrative action.

### Recommended Actions
- **Validate Legitimacy:** Contact the relevant IT administrator to verify if this change was intentional and expected.
- **Monitor Activity:** Implement temporary monitoring rules to track similar events and ensure no unexpected changes occur.
- **Document Findings:** Record this alert as a false positive and update detection logic to reduce future noise.
