### Executive Summary
A known malware command was executed on a normal-criticality endpoint, but there is insufficient evidence to confirm whether it successfully ran or caused harm.

### Final Verdict
**Suspicious**

### Confidence
**Medium**

### Justification
The final risk score of 20 indicates a moderate level of concern. The "IOC in Threat Intel" score of 100 confirms the encoded PowerShell command is associated with known malware (Dridex). However, the "Process Behavior" and "Host Vulnerability" dimensions both scored 0, meaning we have a critical visibility gap into whether the command actually executed and what damage it may have done. The fact that the alert triggered on a non-critical asset reduces the urgency somewhat, but the presence of a known malware signature warrants further investigation.

### Recommended Actions
- **Forensic Analysis:** Run live forensics on `ALU-ENDUSR-01` to determine if the encoded PowerShell command was ever fully decoded and executed.
- **Endpoint Isolation:** Temporarily disconnect the endpoint from the network until the investigation is completed.
- **Threat Hunting:** Search other endpoints for similar encoded PowerShell commands using Velociraptor.
