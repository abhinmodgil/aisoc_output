### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for a known malware behavior (Dridex) involving PowerShell. This is a high-risk, single-host event.
2.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Queries:** Since we have both the process name ('powershell.exe') and the command line, we can start with a detailed process tree analysis to understand how it was started. We should then follow up with memory dumps and network/registry/file system monitoring to identify lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.
3.  **Strategy for Wazuh Queries:** Given the nature of the alert, we want to check if the host has been compromised before. Additionally, since PowerShell is commonly used for lateral movement, we should verify if there are any unusual outbound connections or open ports.
4.  **Strategy for MISP Query:** The encoded PowerShell command is the key IOC here. We should perform a hash-based search in MISP to determine if itâ€™s known malware and gather additional context about its behavior and prevalence.

### Execution Plan

Tool: Velociraptor
