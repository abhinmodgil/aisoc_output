### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for a malicious file hash detected on an internal development workstation. This could indicate either a targeted attack or a compromised developer system.
2.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Queries:** Since we have the exact filename and hash, we can start with detailed process tree analysis to understand how the file was executed. We should also check for any suspicious child processes, network connections, or file modifications made by the executable.
3.  **Strategy for Wazuh Queries:** Given the nature of the alert, it’s important to check if this is an isolated incident or part of a broader pattern. We’ll want to look at recent downloads and executions on the same host to identify whether this is a new attack vector or a recurring issue. Additionally, we should check for any known vulnerabilities in Windows related to the download or execution of files from unknown sources.
4.  **Strategy for Organization Database Queries:** Understanding who owns the affected account ('John') and their typical behavior will help us assess the severity of the situation. If 'John' is an administrator or has elevated privileges, the impact could be more severe than if they were a regular user.
