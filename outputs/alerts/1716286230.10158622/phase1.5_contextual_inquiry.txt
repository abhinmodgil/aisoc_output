--- Contextual Inquiry Output for Alert ID: 1716286230.10158622 ---
--- Associated Agent ID: ALU-001 ---

**Initial Alert Assessment and Dimensional Focus:
**This alert, identified by MITRE Technique T1498 (Network Denial of Service), suggests a potential DDoS-like attack (POST flood) targeting 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01' from Source IP '198.51.100.25'. The key Cybersecurity Dimensions for initial investigation are: Network Behavior (to analyze the POST traffic patterns), IOC in Threat Intel (to check the Source IP), and Contextual Dimension (to assess the criticality of the web application).

**Critical Investigative Questions (Guided by MITRE Technique T1498 and Provided IOCs):
1. How frequently did the Source IP '198.51.100.25' send POST requests to '/cart/add'?
2. Were any other URLs or paths targeted by the same Source IP?
3. Did the HTTP status code '200' indicate successful processing of all POST requests?
4. Is the URL path '/cart/add' a sensitive endpoint requiring rate limiting?
5. Does the agent 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01' have any load balancers or WAFs configured to mitigate DDoS?
6. Are there any other agents reporting similar POST floods from different Source IPs?
7. Is the Source IP '198.51.100.25' listed in any threat intelligence feeds as malicious?
8. Have there been previous alerts or anomalies associated with this Source IP?
9. Can the log file 'C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\u_ex240521.log' be correlated with other security events?
