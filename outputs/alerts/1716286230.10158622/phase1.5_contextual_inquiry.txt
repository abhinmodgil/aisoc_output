--- Contextual Inquiry Output for Alert ID: 1716286230.10158622 ---
--- Associated Agent ID: ALU-001 ---

**Initial Alert Assessment and Dimensional Focus:
**This alert, associated with MITRE Technique T1498 (Network Denial of Service), indicates a high volume of POST requests to '/cart/add' on 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01' from Source IP '198.51.100.25'. T1498 often involves overwhelming resources through HTTP floods. Key Cybersecurity Dimensions include: Network Behavior (POST flood analysis), IOC in Threat Intel (source IP reputation), Contextual Dimension (web application importance), and Host Vulnerability (potential DDoS impact).

**Critical Investigative Questions (Guided by MITRE Technique T1498 and Provided IOCs):
**1. How many POST requests were sent to '/cart/add' within the observed timeframe?
2. What is the average request rate per second during the flood?
3. Did the source IP '198.51.100.25' send any other types of HTTP requests (GET, PUT)?
4. Is the source IP '198.51.100.25' listed in any public or private threat intelligence sources?
5. What is the total bandwidth consumed by these POST requests on 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01'?
6. Can we correlate the POST flood with any other alerts or anomalies on 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01'?
7. Does the URL path '/cart/add' handle sensitive operations or financial transactions?
8. Are there any load balancers, WAFs, or rate limiting rules configured for 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01'?
9. Have similar POST floods been observed on other web servers in the environment?
