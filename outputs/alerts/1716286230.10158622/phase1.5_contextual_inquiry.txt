4. Were any other URLs on 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01' targeted by the same source IP?
5. Is the source IP '198.51.100.25' listed in any threat intelligence feeds for DDoS activity?
6. What is the typical baseline traffic for '/cart/add' on 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01'?
7. Did the POST requests trigger any alerts in WAF or IDS systems?
8. Are there signs of resource exhaustion or degraded performance on 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01'?
9. Have similar patterns been observed from other source IPs targeting this URL?**
