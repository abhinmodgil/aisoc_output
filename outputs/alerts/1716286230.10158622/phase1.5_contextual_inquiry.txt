--- Contextual Inquiry Output for Alert ID: 1716286230.10158622 ---
--- Associated Agent ID: ALU-001 ---

**Initial Alert Assessment and Dimensional Focus:
**This alert suggests a possible Network Denial of Service (NDoS) attack (MITRE T1498) targeting 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01' via excessive POST requests to '/cart/add'. NDoS aims to overwhelm resources. Key Cybersecurity Dimensions include: Network Behavior (POST traffic patterns), IOC in Threat Intel (source IP reputation), Contextual Dimension (web application load), and Host Vulnerability (potential resource exhaustion).

**Critical Investigative Questions (Guided by MITRE Technique T1498 and Provided IOCs):
1. How many POST requests to '/cart/add' did the source IP '198.51.100.25' send within the timeframe?
2. Were all POST requests successful (HTTP status code 200)?
3. What is the average response size (in bytes) for each successful POST request?
4. Does the URL path '/cart/add' handle sensitive operations or financial transactions?
5. Is the agent 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01' configured to rate-limit or throttle incoming POST requests?
6. Have other hosts or services on the same subnet experienced similar POST flooding?
7. Is the source IP '198.51.100.25' associated with any known DDoS botnet infrastructure?
8. Can the W3SVC1 logs reveal additional client-side parameters or headers sent in these POST requests?
9. Are there any signs of further exploitation attempts or lateral movement from 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01'?
