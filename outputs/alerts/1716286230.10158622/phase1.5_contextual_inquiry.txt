--- Contextual Inquiry Output for Alert ID: 1716286230.10158622 ---
--- Associated Agent ID: ALU-001 ---

**Initial Alert Assessment and Dimensional Focus:
**This alert signals a potential Network Denial of Service (NDoS) attack (MITRE T1498), where 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01' received numerous POST requests from '198.51.100.25' targeting '/cart/add'. NDoS aims to overwhelm resources. Key Cybersecurity Dimensions include: Network Behavior (POST traffic analysis), IOC in Threat Intel (source IP reputation), and Contextual Dimension (web application load and response times).

**Critical Investigative Questions (Guided by MITRE Technique T1498 and Provided IOCs):
1. How many POST requests did '198.51.100.25' send to '/cart/add' within the observed timeframe?
2. What was the average request rate per second from '198.51.100.25'?
3. Did the HTTP status code '200' indicate successful processing of all POST requests?
4. Were any error codes returned in the W3SVC1 logs for these POST requests?
5. Does the URL path '/cart/add' handle sensitive operations or financial transactions?
6. Is the agent 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01' configured to limit concurrent connections or enforce rate limits?
7. Are there signs of resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk I/O) on 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01' during the attack?
8. Have similar patterns of POST flooding been observed from '198.51.100.25' on other web servers?
9. Are there additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with '198.51.100.25' in threat intelligence sources?
