**This alert, identified as MITRE Technique T1498 (Network Denial of Service), suggests a high volume of HTTP POST requests to '/cart/add' on 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01' from Source IP '198.51.100.25'. T1498 often targets e-commerce sites. Key Cybersecurity Dimensions include: Network Behavior (POST traffic analysis), IOC in Threat Intel (source IP reputation), and Contextual Dimension (web application exposure).

1. How many POST requests were made to '/cart/add' within the observed timeframe?
2. Did the source IP '198.51.100.25' send any other types of HTTP requests besides POST?
3. Is the source IP '198.51.100.25' listed in any threat intelligence feeds or blacklists?
4. What is the average response size (in bytes) for the POST requests to '/cart/add'?
5. Does the URL path '/cart/add' represent a legitimate endpoint for adding items to a cart?
6. Are there any anomalies in the HTTP status codes returned for these POST requests?
7. Can the log file 'C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\u_ex240521.log' be correlated with other security events?
8. Have similar patterns of POST requests been observed from other sources recently?
9. Are there any additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with the source IP '198.51.100.25'?
