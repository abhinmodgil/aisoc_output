--- Contextual Inquiry Output for Alert ID: 1716286230.10158622 ---
--- Associated Agent ID: ALU-001 ---

**Initial Alert Assessment and Dimensional Focus:**
This alert, identified as MITRE Technique T1498 (Network Denial of Service), indicates a high volume of HTTP POST requests to '/cart/add' on 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01' from Source IP '198.51.100.25'. T1498 often involves overwhelming resources through repeated requests. Critical Cybersecurity Dimensions include: Network Behavior (POST traffic analysis), IOC in Threat Intel (source IP reputation), Contextual Dimension (web application load), and User Attribution (if authenticated sessions are involved).

**Critical Investigative Questions (Guided by MITRE Technique T1498 and Provided IOCs):**
1. How many POST requests were made to '/cart/add' within the timeframe?
2. What is the average response size for each POST request?
3. Does the source IP '198.51.100.25' match any known DDoS or botnet patterns?
4. Have similar POST floods been observed on other web applications hosted on 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01'?
5. Are there any anomalies in the HTTP status codes returned for these POST requests?
6. Can we correlate the POST flood with any spikes in CPU/memory usage on 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01'?
7. Does the URL path '/cart/add' handle sensitive operations (e.g., payment processing)?
8. Are there any additional logs (e.g., WAF logs, firewall logs) capturing the POST flood?
9. Have rate limiting rules been configured for this endpoint to mitigate DDoS risks?
