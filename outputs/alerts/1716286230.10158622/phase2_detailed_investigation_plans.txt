--------------------------------------------------

Question 5: Are there any unusual parameters or payloads being sent in the POST requests?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:**
*   Objective: Identify any suspicious payload or parameter values in the POST requests to determine if they indicate malicious intent.

*   Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):
    1.  Web Access Logs: Analyze the log entries related to the POST requests to extract the request bodies and identify any anomalies.
    2.  WAF Logs (if available): Review any logs generated by the Web Application Firewall (WAF) to see if any rules were triggered based on the request content.
    3.  Packet Capture (PCAP) Analysis: Examine network traffic captures around the time of the alert to look for unusual HTTP headers or payloads.

*   Steps & Example Commands/Queries:
    1.  Extract Request Bodies from Log Files:
        * Use a tool like Log Parser or PowerShell to parse the web access logs and extract the request bodies.
        * Example command using Log Parser:
        ```powershell
        logparser.exe "SELECT cs-uri-query FROM C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex240521.log WHERE sc-status = '200' AND cs-method = 'POST'"
        ```
    2.  Review WAF Logs:
        * If a WAF is deployed, query its logs for any blocked requests matching the alert criteria.
        * Example query using Splunk:
        ```kusto
        index=waf sourcetype="waf:access" status=403 cs-uri-path=/cart/add cs-method=POST | stats count by cs-uri-query
        ```
    3.  PCAP Analysis:
        * Use Wireshark or tcpdump to analyze packet captures taken during the timeframe of the alert.
        * Look for unusual HTTP headers such as User-Agent, Content-Type, or unexpected request methods.
        * Example filter in Wireshark:
        ```plaintext
        http.request.method == "POST" && ip.src == "88.88.88.88"
        ```

*   Expected Outcome/Interpretation:
    - ✅ If the request bodies contain suspicious parameters like `cmd=ping`, `cmd=id`, or other system commands, flag them as potentially malicious.
    - ❌ If all POST requests appear normal and do not include any obvious signs of exploitation, continue monitoring for similar patterns.

*   **Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):**
    1.  **SIEM (Splunk/Wazuh/Elasticsearch):** Analyze recent log entries for '198.51.100.25'.
    2.  **Firewall Logs (Palo Alto/Cisco ASA/PfSense):** Check for existing rules or attempts to block the IP.
    3.  **Network Flow Analysis (Zeek/Suricata):** Look for unusual network flows involving '198.51.100.25'.
    4.  **Threat Intelligence Feeds (MISP/VirusTotal/AlienVault OTX):** Cross-check the IP against known malicious entities.

*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **SIEM Log Search (Splunk Query):**
        *   `index="web_logs" src_ip="198.51.100.25"`
        *   `| stats count by status_code method url`
        *   `| sort -count`
        *   `| head 20`
        *   `| eval risk_level=case(status_code==403,"High",status_code==404,"Medium",status_code>400,"Low")`
        *   `| table _time, src_ip, status_code, method, url, count, risk_level`

    2.  **Firewall Rule Check (CLI Command):**
        *   `show ip nat translation outside 198.51.100.25`
        *   `show access-lists | include 198.51.100.25`
        *   `show running-config | grep deny 198.51.100.25`

    3.  **Network Flow Analysis (Suricata Query):**
        *   `grep "198.51.100.25" /var/log/zeek/conn.log`
        *   `cat /var/log/suricata/fast.log | grep "198.51.100.25"`

    4.  **Threat Intel Lookup (VirusTotal API):**
        *   `curl -X GET "
        *   `jq '.data.reputation'`

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If the IP shows repeated high-risk activities (403/404 errors, excessive POSTs), blocking might be prudent until full analysis.
    - ❌ If the IP appears benign or only exhibits normal traffic patterns, do not block unless confirmed malicious via additional checks.
