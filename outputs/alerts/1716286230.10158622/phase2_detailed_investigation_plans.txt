--- Detailed Investigative Questions and Plans ---

Question 1: How frequently did the Source IP '198.51.100.25' send POST requests to '/cart/add'?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:**
*   **Objective:** Analyze HTTP server logs to determine the frequency at which <SOURCE_IP> sent POST requests to path '/cart/add'.

*   **Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):**
    1.  **Web Access Logs (C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\u_ex240521.log):** Examine raw IIS/W3C logs for POST requests to '/cart/add' from <SOURCE_IP>.
    2.  **Wazuh API (for Agent ID <AGENT_ID>):** Query logs for similar POST requests from <SOURCE_IP> across multiple hosts.
    3.  **Velociraptor (on <AGENT_HOSTNAME>):** Query endpoint to retrieve recent web access logs for analysis.

*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **IIS/W3C Log Analysis (on <AGENT_HOSTNAME>):**
        * Open W3C log file: `notepad.exe C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex240521.log`
        * Filter for POST requests to '/cart/add':
            ```text
            # Find entries where URI contains "/cart/add" and method is POST
            2024-05-21 10:10:30 <SOURCE_IP> POST /cart/add - 200
            2024-05-21 10:11:00 <SOURCE_IP> POST /cart/add - 200
           ...
            ```
        * Count occurrences of <SOURCE_IP>:
            ```text
            $count = 0
            foreach ($line in Get-Content C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex240521.log) {
                if ($line -match "^<SOURCE_IP>.*POST \/cart\/add") {
                    $count++
                }
            }
            echo "$count POST requests from <SOURCE_IP>"
            ```

    2.  **Wazuh API (Target Agent ID: <AGENT_ID>):**
        * Query for POST requests to '/cart/add' from <SOURCE_IP>:
          ```http
          GET /agents/<AGENT_ID>/logs/summary?q=http.method:POST AND http.uri:/cart/add AND srcip:<SOURCE_IP>
          ```
        * Optional: Aggregate results across multiple agents:
          ```http
          GET /agents/*/logs/summary?q=http.method:POST AND http.uri:/cart/add AND srcip:<SOURCE_IP>
          ```

    3.  **Velociraptor (Target Hostname: <AGENT_HOSTNAME>):**
        * Query to retrieve recent web access logs:
          ```sql
          SELECT * FROM Artifact.WebAccessLogs(Hostname='<AGENT_HOSTNAME>')
          ```
        * Extract POST requests to '/cart/add' from the retrieved logs.

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If <SOURCE_IP> made frequent POST requests to '/cart/add' within a short timeframe, it suggests automated activity (bot, DDoS attempt).
    - ❌ If <SOURCE_IP> only made occasional legitimate requests, consider investigating further (e.g., geo-location, user-agent, session duration).
--------------------------------------------------

Question 2: Were any other URLs or paths targeted by the same Source IP?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:**
*   **Objective:** Identify additional HTTP requests made by <SOURCE_IP> around the same timeframe (<TIMEFRAME>) to determine if there's a broader attack pattern.

*   **Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):**
    1.  **Web Access Logs (C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\u_ex240521.log):** Analyze raw access logs for other unusual POST requests.
    2.  **Wazuh API (for Agent ID <AGENT_ID>):** Search logs for similar activities or anomalies involving <SOURCE_IP>.
    3.  **Velociraptor (on <AGENT_HOSTNAME>):** Query endpoint to check process status and compare with /proc listings.

*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **Raw Log Analysis (on <AGENT_HOSTNAME>):**
        * Open access log file: `notepad.exe C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex240521.log`
        * Search for POST requests near timestamp <TIMEFRAME>:
          `grep "POST /cart/add" C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex240521.log`
        * Look for other POST requests targeting different paths:
          `grep "POST" C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex240521.log | grep -v "/cart/add"`
        * Note any unusual paths or parameters.

    2.  **Wazuh API (Target Agent ID: <AGENT_ID>):**
        * Query for POST requests matching <SOURCE_IP> and other suspicious paths:
          `GET /agents/<AGENT_ID>/logs/summary?q=data.http.method:POST AND data.http.url:/cart/add AND data.source.ip:<SOURCE_IP>`
        * Expand to include other paths:
          `GET /agents/<AGENT_ID>/logs/summary?q=data.http.method:POST AND data.http.url:/ AND data.source.ip:<SOURCE_IP>`

    3.  **Velociraptor (Target Hostname: <AGENT_HOSTNAME> or Agent ID: <AGENT_ID>):**
        * Query to list recent HTTP requests:
          `SELECT * FROM Artifact.Web.HTTPRequests(Hostname='<AGENT_HOSTNAME>') LIMIT 500;`
        * Filter for POST requests with <SOURCE_IP>:
          `WHERE data.client_ip == <SOURCE_IP> AND data.request_method == "POST"`
        * Sort by timestamp to focus on those near <TIMEFRAME>.

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If multiple POST requests to different paths are found, especially with unusual parameters, it suggests a wider attack attempt.
    - ❌ If only one path is observed, it could indicate a more focused attack or a misconfiguration rather than widespread scanning.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 3: Did the HTTP status code '200' indicate successful processing of all POST requests?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:**
*   **Objective:** Confirm whether all POST requests to URL path '/cart/add' received HTTP status code '200' on host <AGENT_HOSTNAME>.

*   **Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):**
    1.  **Web Access Logs (Local File):** Review raw access logs at location <LOG_LOCATION> for entries matching <SOURCE_IP> and method POST.
    2.  **Wazuh API (Target Agent ID: <AGENT_ID>):** Search logs for related events (e.g., web server access logs, error logs).
    3.  **Organizational Data Lookup:** Consult application-specific documentation or monitoring dashboards to determine expected behavior for successful cart additions.

*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **Review Raw Web Access Log (Local File):**
        * Navigate to <LOG_LOCATION> and open the latest log file (e.g., u_ex240521.log).
        * Search for entries containing both <SOURCE_IP> and POST method:
            `grep -E '^<SOURCE_IP>|POST /cart/add' <LOG_LOCATION>/<LOG_FILE>`
        * Look for corresponding HTTP status codes (should be 200 for success):
            `grep -E '^<SOURCE_IP>|POST /cart/add|200' <LOG_LOCATION>/<LOG_FILE>`

    2.  **Wazuh API (Target Agent ID: <AGENT_ID>):**
        * Search for web server access logs related to <SOURCE_IP>:
            `GET /agents/<AGENT_ID>/logs/summary?q=data.http.method:POST AND data.url.path:/cart/add AND data.source.ip:<SOURCE_IP>`
        * Search for any error logs mentioning <SOURCE_IP> or POST requests:
            `GET /agents/<AGENT_ID>/logs/summary?q=data.http.method:POST AND data.source.ip:<SOURCE_IP> OR data.error.message:*POST*`

    3.  **Organizational Data Lookup:**
        * Consult application-specific documentation or dashboards to understand normal flow and expected response codes for successful cart additions.
        * If possible, cross-reference with backend system logs or transaction records to validate whether items were actually added to carts.

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If all entries match <SOURCE_IP>, POST, and return 200, likely all requests succeeded.
    - ❌ If some entries have non-200 status codes, investigate why they failed (e.g., validation issues, rate limiting, backend errors).
    - ❌ If no entries match <SOURCE_IP> or POST, then either the traffic wasn't logged correctly or the source didn't attempt cart additions.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 4: Is the URL path '/cart/add' a sensitive endpoint requiring rate limiting?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:***   Objective: Assess whether the observed POST request to '/cart/add' is legitimate shopping cart activity or potentially malicious traffic.

*   Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):
    1.  **Application Logs (C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\u_ex240521.log):** Review recent entries around the timestamp of the alert for additional context.
    2.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Logs (if available):** Look for any WAF rules triggered during the same timeframe.
    3.  **Organizational Asset Inventory:** Check if '/cart/add' is documented as a valid endpoint in application architecture diagrams or documentation.

*   Steps & Example Commands/Queries:
    1.  **Review Application Logs:**
        * Open the specified log file (C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\u_ex240521.log) and locate entries near the alert's timestamp.
        * Look for any unusual patterns or anomalies in the HTTP method, URL paths, client IPs, or response codes.
        * Pay attention to any failed login attempts or unauthorized access attempts preceding or following the POST requests.

    2.  **Check WAF Logs (if available):**
        * If WAF logs exist, search for entries matching the same timeframe as the alert.
        * Look for any blocked requests or warnings related to '/cart/add'.
        * Analyze the reason behind the blocking (e.g., SQL injection attempt, XSS payload).

    3.  **Validate Endpoint in Asset Inventory:**
        * Consult organizational asset inventory documents or databases to confirm whether '/cart/add' is a legitimate endpoint.
        * Ensure it aligns with expected functionality and isn't a deprecated or unused feature.

*   Expected Outcome/Interpretation:
    - ✅ If the application logs show normal shopping cart activity (multiple users adding items to their carts), and there are no WAF blocks or anomalies, consider it benign.
    - ❌ If the logs reveal repeated failed login attempts followed by successful POST requests, or if the WAF flags SQL injection attempts targeting '/cart/add', treat it as suspicious.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 5: Does the agent 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01' have any load balancers or WAFs configured to mitigate DDoS?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:**
*   **Objective:** Identify if the server 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01' uses load balancers or Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to protect against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

*   **Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):**
    1.  **Network Infrastructure Documentation (Internal):** Look for network diagrams, security policies, or documentation mentioning load balancing or WAF solutions.
    2.  **Wazuh API (Target Agent ID: <AGENT_ID>):** Query logs and configurations to see if Wazuh itself detects any load balancer or WAF-related rules being triggered.
    3.  **Organizational Asset Inventory (Optional):** Check if the server is listed under assets protected by specific load balancers or WAF appliances.

*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **Review Network Diagrams or Security Policies:**
        * Manually inspect recent network architecture documents or security policies to identify if 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01' is behind a load balancer or WAF.
        * Look for references to 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01' in sections about DDoS protection or application layer security.

    2.  **Wazuh API (Target Agent ID: <AGENT_ID>):**
        * Query for alerts or logs indicating load balancer or WAF activity:
        ```http
        GET /agents/<AGENT_ID>/logs/summary?q=data.rule.description:load_balancer OR data.rule.description:waf
        ```
        * If Wazuh monitors the load balancer/WAF appliance itself, query for its logs:
        ```http
        GET /agents/<LOAD_BALANCER_AGENT_ID>/logs/summary?q=data.rule.description:ddos OR data.rule.description:botnet
        ```

    3.  **Asset Inventory Lookup:**
        * If available, search asset management system (e.g., CMDB, ITSM tool) for 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01'.
        * Check if it's tagged as protected by specific load balancer or WAF devices.

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If network docs or Wazuh logs indicate 'ALU-WEB-PROD-01' is behind a load balancer or WAF, it confirms mitigation is in place.
    - ❌ If nothing is found, consider investigating further into network topology changes or reviewing DDoS protection strategy.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 6: Are there any other agents reporting similar POST floods from different Source IPs?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:**
*   **Objective:** Identify additional agents experiencing frequent POST requests from various source IPs, potentially indicating a broader network attack.

*   **Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):**
    1.  **Wazuh API (for Agent IDs):** Query logs for recent POST flood alerts across multiple agents.
    2.  **Velociraptor (on Agents):** Collect HTTP logs and analyze POST request patterns per agent.
    3.  **SIEM (Centralized Logs):** Aggregate POST flood alerts from multiple agents into one view.

*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **Wazuh API (for Agent IDs):**
        * List all active agents: `GET /agents/active`
        * Query each agent's logs for POST flood alerts:
          `GET /agents/<AGENT_ID>/logs/summary?q=rule.description:POST flood`
        * Aggregate results: `GET /agents/*/logs/summary?q=rule.description:POST flood`
        (Note: This assumes Wazuh stores logs centrally and exposes them via API)

    2.  **Velociraptor (on Agents):**
        * Target all agents with HTTP logs collection enabled:
          `SELECT * FROM Artifact.Web.HTTPLogs()`
        * Filter for POST requests:
          `WHERE method = "POST"`
        * Group by agent and source IP:
          `GROUP BY agent_hostname, src_ip`
        * Analyze top offenders:
          `ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 10`

    3.  **SIEM (Centralized Log Aggregation):**
        * Create a custom query to aggregate POST flood alerts from multiple agents:
          `source="wazuh*" AND rule.description:"POST flood"`
        * Visualize results:
          `timechart sum(count) by agent_hostname`

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If multiple agents report similar POST flood alerts from different source IPs, it suggests a coordinated attack targeting the network.
    - ❌ If only one agent reports such activity, it could be isolated misconfiguration or benign traffic.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 7: Is the Source IP '198.51.100.25' listed in any threat intelligence feeds as malicious?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:***   Objective: Determine if external <SOURCE_IP> is flagged in threat intelligence databases, public blacklists, or internal TI systems.

*   Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):
    1.  MISP Server: Check whether <SOURCE_IP> exists as an IOC in internal or synchronized threat feeds.
    2.  Wazuh API (Optional): Scan for past incidents or alerts referencing <SOURCE_IP> in logs across any agents.
    3.  External Blacklists (Optional Recommendation): Public APIs like AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal for <SOURCE_IP>.

*   Steps & Example Commands/Queries:
    1.  MISP Query (via API for <SOURCE_IP>):
        * Endpoint: `GET /attributes/restSearch`
        * Query Body Template (substitute <SOURCE_IP>):
        ```json
        {
            "value": "<SOURCE_IP>"
        }
        ```
        * Also search other relevant IP types if applicable and check for sightings, tags, galaxy classifications.

    2.  Wazuh API (optional, search for <SOURCE_IP>):
        * Search across logs for activity related to the target user <USERNAME> and <SOURCE_IP>:
        ```http
        ```
        * Or generic search for <SOURCE_IP> across all agents (use with caution for common IPs):
        ```http
        GET /agents/000/search?query=<SOURCE_IP>
        ```
        (Note: '000' is a placeholder for 'all agents' in some Wazuh API contexts, actual implementation might vary)

*   Expected Outcome/Interpretation:
    - ✅ If <SOURCE_IP> is present in MISP or other feeds with relevant malicious tags, it increases suspicion.
    - ❌ If <SOURCE_IP> is clean, investigate further (geo-IP, ASN, frequency, other targeted systems).
--------------------------------------------------

Question 8: Have there been previous alerts or anomalies associated with this Source IP?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:**
*   **Objective:** Identify prior alerts or unusual activities involving <SOURCE_IP>.

*   **Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):**
    1.  **Wazuh API (for Agent ID <AGENT_ID>):** Search logs for past alerts matching <SOURCE_IP> or similar patterns.
    2.  **SIEM (Centralized Log Analysis):** Query for historical alerts or anomalies involving <SOURCE_IP>.
    3.  **Threat Intelligence Feeds (Optional):** Check if <SOURCE_IP> is flagged in external TI services.

*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **Wazuh API (Target Agent ID: <AGENT_ID>):**
        * Search for alerts related to <SOURCE_IP>:
          ```http
          GET /agents/<AGENT_ID>/alerts?q=source_ip:<SOURCE_IP>
          ```
        * Search for alerts with similar HTTP method/path/status code combinations:
          ```http
          GET /agents/<AGENT_ID>/alerts?q=http_method:POST AND http_path:/cart/add AND http_status_code:200
          ```

    2.  **SIEM Query (Assuming ElasticSearch/Splunk/Grafana/Loki):**
        * Query for alerts or anomalies involving <SOURCE_IP> over a timeframe:
          ```kql
          index="wazuh-*" AND source_ip="<SOURCE_IP>"
          ```
        * Query for similar patterns (POST /cart/add 200):
          ```kql
          index="wazuh-*" AND http_method:POST AND http_path:/cart/add AND http_status_code:200
          ```

    3.  **External Threat Intelligence (Optional):**
        * Look up <SOURCE_IP> in services like AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, etc.:
          ```bash
          curl -s " | jq.
          ```

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If <SOURCE_IP> triggered multiple alerts or anomalies in the past, it's likely involved in ongoing or repeated attacks.
    - ❌ If <SOURCE_IP> hasn't been seen before, consider investigating further (e.g., geo-location, ASN, timing, volume of traffic).
--------------------------------------------------

Question 9: Can the log file 'C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\u_ex240521.log' be correlated with other security events?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:**
*   **Objective:** Analyze the contents of the log file 'C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\u_ex240521.log' to identify any unusual patterns or correlations with other security events.

*   **Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):**
    1.  **Windows Event Logs (Local Machine):** Review IIS logs (Application event logs) for additional context around the HTTP request.
    2.  **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Search for related alerts or anomalies involving the same IP addresses or URLs.
    3.  **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Look for any corresponding EDR events on the host (e.g., process creation, network connections).

*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **Review Local Log File ('C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\u_ex240521.log'):**
        * Open the log file in a text editor and review the entries for the specified date/time range.
        * Look for repeated POST requests to '/cart/add' from the same source IP (198.51.100.25).
        * Note any unusual parameters or payloads associated with these requests.

    2.  **Check Application Event Logs (IIS Logs):**
        * In Windows Event Viewer, navigate to Applications and Services Logs → Microsoft → Windows → WebServices → Operational.
        * Filter the logs for the same timestamp and source IP to see if there are any additional details about the request.
        * Pay attention to error codes, response sizes, and any associated user-agent strings.

    3.  **Search SIEM for Related Events:**
        * In the SIEM console, run a query to search for events related to the source IP (198.51.100.25) or URL path ('/cart/add').
        * Look for alerts generated by IDS/IPS or other security products triggered during the timeframe of the log file.
        * Correlate these events with other logs such as firewall logs, DNS queries, or authentication attempts.

    4.  **EDR Investigation (if available):**
        * Access the EDR dashboard and search for events related to the host (ALU-WEB-PROD-01) during the timeframe of the log file.
        * Look for process creations, network connections, or registry modifications that coincide with the timestamps of the log entries.
        * Check for any unusual outbound connections or DLL loads that could indicate malware activity.

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If the log file shows consistent high-volume POST requests to '/cart/add' from a single source IP, and these requests correlate with other security events (e.g., failed login attempts, unexpected outbound traffic), it suggests a possible attack attempt.
    - ❌ If the log file does not contain any unusual entries, or if the requests appear legitimate based on the context of the application, then the alert may be a false positive.
