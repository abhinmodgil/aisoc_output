*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **ELK Log Parsing (Example Kibana Query):**
        *   Query:
        ```kql
        {
            "@timestamp": [now-24h TO now],
            "message": "/cart/add",
            "http.response.status_code": 200
        } | stats avg(duration) by http.request.method
        ```
        *   Expected Output: Average duration per method (`POST`) over last 24 hours.

    2.  **Grafana/PromQL (CPU Usage):**
        *   Query:
        ```promql
        sum(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) by (instance)
        ```
        *   Expected Output: CPU idle percentage for the instance hosting the application.

    3.  **Zeek/TCP Flow Analysis (Example Zeek Script):**
        *   Script:
        ```lua
        event tcp_connection(c: connection) {
            if (c$id$orig_h == 88.88.88.88 && c$id$resp_p == 80) {
                print("TCP flow detected:", c$id);
            }
        }
        ```
        *   Expected Output: List of TCP connections matching the criteria.

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If the observed request rate and latency align closely with historical averages, the traffic might have been legitimate.

        ```
        *   Expected Results: Top IPs making POST requests to `/cart/add`.

*   Expected Outcome/Interpretation:
    - ✅ If multiple hosts show similar POST flood patterns, it suggests a coordinated attack or misconfiguration.
    - ❌ If only one host shows the issue, focus on local analysis (endpoint logs, application logs) to determine cause.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 8: Are there any rate limiting or CAPTCHA mechanisms implemented for '/cart/add'?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan: 
**
*   Objective: Determine if the application has built-in protections against brute-force attacks targeting '/cart/add'.

*   Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):
    1.  Application Logs (C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\u\_ex240521.log): Analyze recent log entries for '/cart/add' to see if there are multiple failed attempts followed by successful ones.
    2.  Web Application Firewall (WAF) Config: Review WAF ruleset to ensure it blocks excessive POSTs to '/cart/add'.
    3.  Rate Limiting Configuration: Check IIS settings or custom middleware to verify if request throttling is enabled.
    4.  Authentication Mechanisms: Examine if the endpoint requires session cookies, CSRF tokens, or other anti-forgery measures.

*   Steps & Example Commands/Queries:
    1.  Log Analysis (Example Query):
        *   PowerShell Command:
        ```powershell
        Get-Content C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex240521.log | Select-String "/cart/add" | Measure-Object -Line
        ```
        *   Expected Output: Number of occurrences of '/cart/add' in last hour.
    2.  WAF Ruleset Inspection:
        *   Manual Review: Open WAF config files (`C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\waf\config.xml`) and look for rules matching `/cart/add`.
    3.  Rate Limiting Settings:
        *   IIS Manager: Navigate to `Application Pools > DefaultAppPool > Advanced Settings` and check `Limits > Maximum concurrent requests per CPU`.
    4.  Authentication Checks:
        *   Inspect Request Headers: Use Fiddler or Burp Suite to capture headers sent during POST requests to '/cart/add'. Look for session IDs, CSRF tokens, or other security headers.

*   Expected Outcome/Interpretation:
    - ✅ If logs show failed POSTs followed by success within short intervals, or WAF rules block excessive traffic, it indicates proper protection.
    - ❌ If logs show only failed POSTs without success, or WAF does not have rules for '/cart/add', consider implementing rate limits or CAPTCHA challenges.
