--- Detailed Investigative Questions and Plans ---

Question 1: How many POST requests were made to '/cart/add' within the observed timeframe?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:**
*   **Objective:** Count the number of HTTP POST requests to path '/cart/add' within the specified timeframe.

*   **Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):**
    1.  **Wazuh API:** Query logs for POST requests to '/cart/add'.
    2.  **Windows Event Logs (Event Viewer):** Look for event IDs related to web server access logs.
    3.  **Organizational Web Access Log Files (C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex240521.log):** Directly inspect raw access logs.

*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **Wazuh API (Endpoint: /agents/<AGENT_ID>/logs/summary):**
        * Query for POST requests to '/cart/add':
          ```http
          GET /agents/<AGENT_ID>/logs/summary?q=http.method:POST AND http.request.uri:/cart/add
          ```
        * Expected Result: JSON response containing count of matching entries.

    2.  **Windows Event Viewer (Local Machine):**
        * Open Event Viewer → Application and Services Logs → Microsoft → Windows → IIS-Logging → Operational.
        * Filter for Event ID 6205 (IIS access log entry created).
        * Sort/filter by URI path '/cart/add' and HTTP method 'POST'.
        * Count the number of occurrences manually or through a script (PowerShell, Python, etc.).

    3.  **Direct Inspection of Raw Access Logs (C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex240521.log):**
        * Open the log file in a text editor.
        * Search for lines starting with 'POST /cart/add' and count them manually.
        * Alternatively, use PowerShell or a scripting language to automate counting:
          ```powershell
          $count = 0;
          Get-Content C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex240521.log | Where { $_ -match '^POST \/cart\/add' } | Measure-Object | Select -ExpandProperty Count
          ```

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If the count is consistent with expected traffic levels, it's likely normal usage.
    - ❌ If the count exceeds typical thresholds or shows spikes, it could indicate automated/bot traffic.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 2: Did the source IP '198.51.100.25' send any other types of HTTP requests besides POST?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:**
*   **Objective:** Identify if <SOURCE_IP> sent any other HTTP request methods (e.g., GET, PUT, DELETE) during the same timeframe around the POST requests.

*   **Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):**
    1.  **Web Access Logs (C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\u_ex240521.log):** Examine raw logs for additional entries matching <SOURCE_IP>.
    2.  **Wazuh API (for Agent ID <AGENT_ID>):** Search logs for related events (e.g., other POST requests, unusual method usage).
    3.  **Velociraptor (on <AGENT_HOSTNAME>):** Query endpoint to check for other suspicious activities involving <SOURCE_IP>.

*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **Raw Log Analysis (on <AGENT_HOSTNAME>):**
        * Open the log file: `notepad.exe C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex240521.log`
        * Search for <SOURCE_IP>: Ctrl+F -> Find <SOURCE_IP>
        * Look for entries where RequestType!= POST (or specifically look for GET, PUT, DELETE)
        * Note timestamps and URLs associated with non-POST requests.

    2.  **Wazuh API (Target Agent ID: <AGENT_ID>):**
        * Search for other POST requests from the same <SOURCE_IP> during the same timeframe:
          `GET /agents/<AGENT_ID>/logs/summary?q=data.source.ip:<SOURCE_IP> AND data.http.method:POST AND timestamp:[2024-05-21T10:00 TO 2024-05-21T10:20]`
        * Search for other unusual methods (e.g., GET, PUT, DELETE) from <SOURCE_IP>:
          `GET /agents/<AGENT_ID>/logs/summary?q=data.source.ip:<SOURCE_IP> AND (data.http.method:GET OR data.http.method:PUT OR data.http.method:DELETE)`

    3.  **Velociraptor (Target Hostname: <AGENT_HOSTNAME> or Agent ID: <AGENT_ID>):**
        * Query to list recent HTTP requests from <SOURCE_IP>:
          ```sql
          SELECT * FROM Artifact.Web.HTTPRequests(Hostname='<AGENT_HOSTNAME>') WHERE SourceIp == '<SOURCE_IP>' ORDER BY Timestamp DESC LIMIT 100;
          ```
        * Advanced query to detect anomalies in HTTP methods:
          ```sql
          SELECT * FROM Artifact.Web.HTTPRequests(Hostname='<AGENT_HOSTNAME>') WHERE SourceIp == '<SOURCE_IP>' GROUP BY HttpMethod HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
          ```

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If <SOURCE_IP> made only POST requests during the timeframe, it's likely a bot targeting the POST endpoint.
    - ❌ If <SOURCE_IP> also made other HTTP methods (especially GET or PUT), it suggests more sophisticated scanning or exploitation attempts.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 3: Is the source IP '198.51.100.25' listed in any threat intelligence feeds or blacklists?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:**
*   **Objective:** Determine if external <SOURCE_IP> is flagged in threat intelligence databases, public blacklists, or internal TI systems.

*   **Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):**
    1.  **MISP Server:** Check whether <SOURCE_IP> exists as an IOC in internal or synchronized threat feeds.
    2.  **Wazuh API (Optional):** Scan for past incidents or alerts referencing <SOURCE_IP> in logs across any agents.
    3.  **External Blacklists (Optional Recommendation):** Public APIs like AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal for <SOURCE_IP>.

*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **MISP Query (via API for <SOURCE_IP>):**
        *   Endpoint: `GET /attributes/restSearch`
        ```json
        {{
          "value": "<SOURCE_IP>"
        }}
        ```
        *   Also search other relevant IP types if applicable and check for sightings, tags, galaxy classifications.

    2.  **Wazuh API (optional, search for <SOURCE_IP>):**
        *   Search across logs for activity related to the target user <USERNAME> and <SOURCE_IP>:
        ```http
        GET /security/user/<USERNAME>/logs?q=srcip:<SOURCE_IP>
        ```
        ```http
        GET /agents/000/search?query=<SOURCE_IP>
        ```
        (Note: '000' is a placeholder for 'all agents' in some Wazuh API contexts, actual implementation might vary)

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If <SOURCE_IP> is present in MISP or other feeds with relevant malicious tags, it increases suspicion.
    - ❌ If <SOURCE_IP> is clean, investigate further (geo-IP, ASN, frequency, other targeted systems).
--------------------------------------------------

Question 4: What is the average response size (in bytes) for the POST requests to '/cart/add'?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:**
*   **Objective:** Calculate the average response size for POST requests to '/cart/add'. This metric helps assess potential DDoS impact and resource consumption.

*   **Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):**
    1.  **Wazuh API:** Query logs for HTTP responses matching the path '/cart/add' and extract response sizes.
    2.  **Windows Event Logs (Event ID 4624):** Look for authentication failures around the same timeframe.
    3.  **Web Access Log (C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex240521.log):** Directly inspect raw log entries for detailed request/response metrics.

*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **Wazuh API (Target Agent ID: <AGENT_ID>):**
        * Query for POST requests to '/cart/add':
            ```http
            GET /agents/<AGENT_ID>/logs/summary?q=http.method:POST AND http.url:/cart/add
            ```
        * Extract response sizes (assuming JSON format):
            ```python
            import json
            import requests

            # Replace with real agent ID
            agent_id = "<AGENT_ID>"

            url = f"
            headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}

            # Get summary logs
            response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
            data = json.loads(response.text)

            # Filter for POST requests to '/cart/add'
            filtered_logs = [log for log in data["items"] if log["data"]["http.method"] == "POST" and "/cart/add" in log["data"]["http.url"]]

            # Extract response sizes
            response_sizes = []
            for log in filtered_logs:
                response_size = int(log["data"]["http.response.bytes"])
                response_sizes.append(response_size)

            # Calculate average
            avg_response_size = sum(response_sizes) / len(response_sizes)
            print(f"Avg response size: {avg_response_size} bytes")
            ```

    2.  **Windows Event Logs (Event ID 4624):**
        * Query for failed login attempts during the same timeframe as the POST requests:
            ```powershell
            Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
                LogName = 'Security';
                ID = 4624;
                StartTime = $startTime;
                EndTime = $endTime;
            } | Where-Object { $_.Message -match 'Failed logon' }
            ```

    3.  **Raw Web Access Log Inspection:**
        * Open the log file at `C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex240521.log`.
        * Search for entries containing '/cart/add' and filter for POST requests.
        * Extract response sizes from the `sc-status` field.
        * Calculate the average response size manually or programmatically.

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If the average response size is low (< 500 bytes), it suggests minimal impact on server resources.
    - ❌ If the average response size is high (> 10 KB), it could indicate a significant load on the server, potentially leading to performance degradation or denial of service.
    - ❌ If there's a spike in failed login attempts around the same timeframe, it might suggest a brute force attack targeting the application.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 5: Does the URL path '/cart/add' represent a legitimate endpoint for adding items to a cart?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:**
*   **Objective:** Assess whether the observed HTTP request method (`POST`) and URL path (`/cart/add`) align with expected functionality for a shopping cart application.

*   **Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):**
    1.  **Application Documentation (Internal or External):** Review official documentation or codebase for the web application's endpoints and their intended purposes.
    2.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Logs (if available):** Analyze logs from a WAF (e.g., ModSecurity, Cloudflare WAF) to identify anomalies or blocked requests.
    3.  **Local Log Analysis (Windows Event Viewer or Linux Syslog):** Examine system logs for additional context around the observed POST requests.

*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **Review Application Documentation:**
        * Identify the purpose of the `/cart/add` endpoint based on official documentation or code comments.
        * Look for references to POST methods and associated actions in the documentation.

    2.  **Check WAF Logs (if available):**
        * Query WAF logs for any entries related to the source IP (`198.51.100.25`) or similar requests to `/cart/add`.
        * Pay attention to any detected anomalies or blocked requests that could indicate misuse.

    3.  **Local Log Analysis:**
        * On the server hosting the web application, examine local logs such as Windows Event Viewer or Linux Syslog for related entries.
        * Look for entries indicating successful or failed POST requests to `/cart/add`.

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If the `/cart/add` endpoint is documented as accepting POST requests and matches expected behavior, it may be legitimate.
    - ❌ If there is no documentation or the observed behavior deviates significantly from what is expected, it suggests potential misuse or misconfiguration.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 6: Are there any anomalies in the HTTP status codes returned for these POST requests?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:**
*   **Objective:** Identify unusual patterns in HTTP response codes for POST requests to '/cart/add' on host <AGENT_HOSTNAME>.

*   **Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):**
    1.  **Web Access Logs (C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex240521.log):** Analyze raw access logs for specific path ('/cart/add').
    2.  **Wazuh API (Target Agent ID: <AGENT_ID>):** Search for related alerts or logs containing the same timestamp range.
    3.  **Velociraptor (Target Hostname: <AGENT_HOSTNAME>):** Query endpoint to retrieve recent network connections and HTTP transactions.

*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **Raw Log Analysis (On <AGENT_HOSTNAME>):**
        * Open access log file: `notepad.exe C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex240521.log`
        * Filter for POST requests to '/cart/add':
          `grep "POST \/cart\/add" u_ex240521.log`
        * Review response codes (look for 400, 500, etc.) and associated timestamps.

    2.  **Wazuh API (Target Agent ID: <AGENT_ID>):**
        * Query for alerts triggered around the same timeframe:
          `GET /agents/<AGENT_ID>/alerts?start_time=2024-05-21T10:00:00&end_time=2024-05-21T11:00:00&q=alert.description:Network DDoS Attack`
        * Search for logs containing the same timestamp range:
          `GET /agents/<AGENT_ID>/logs/summary?q=starttime:[2024-05-21T10:00 TO 2024-05-21T11:00]`

    3.  **Velociraptor (Target Hostname: <AGENT_HOSTNAME>):**
        * Query to collect recent network connections:
          ```sql
          SELECT * FROM Artifact.Network.Connections(Hostname='<AGENT_HOSTNAME>', TimestampRange='[2024-05-21T10:00 TO 2024-05-21T11:00]');
          ```
        * Query to retrieve recent HTTP transactions:
          ```sql
          SELECT * FROM Artifact.Web.HTTPTransactions(Hostname='<AGENT_HOSTNAME>', TimestampRange='[2024-05-21T10:00 TO 2024-05-21T11:00]');
          ```

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If most responses are 200 OK, and only occasional non-success codes appear, it could indicate normal operation with occasional errors.
    - ❌ If a large portion of requests return unexpected error codes (e.g., 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error), it suggests potential issues with the application logic or backend services.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 7: Can the log file 'C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\u_ex240521.log' be correlated with other security events?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:**
*   **Objective:** Analyze the specified log file ('C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\u_ex240521.log') for security-relevant entries and correlate them with other security events.

*   **Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):**
    1.  **Windows Event Logs (Local Log File Analysis):** Review raw event logs for correlation with IIS logs.
    2.  **Wazuh API (Remote Agent Query):** Query remote agent logs for matching events.
    3.  **SIEM Correlation (Centralized Log Aggregation):** Cross-reference with other security events in a centralized SIEM.

*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **Windows Event Log Parsing (Local Log File Analysis):**
        * Open the log file in a text editor and parse for relevant fields like source IP, user identity, and HTTP method.
        * Look for correlated events such as failed login attempts, unusual account activities, or network connection attempts around the same timestamp.

    2.  **Wazuh API Query (Remote Agent Query):**
        * Query Wazuh API for agent-specific logs:
            ```http
            GET /agents/<AGENT_ID>/logs/summary?q=data.source.ip:<SOURCE_IP> AND data.http.method:POST AND data.url.path:/cart/add AND data.http.status_code:200
            ```
        * This will return any matching events logged by the Wazuh agent on the affected server.

    3.  **SIEM Correlation (Centralized Log Aggregation):**
        * In a SIEM platform, search for related events based on the extracted IOCs and entities:
            * Source IP (`<SOURCE_IP>`)
            * User Identity (`<USERNAME>`)
            * HTTP Method (`POST`)
            * URL Path (`/cart/add`)
            * HTTP Status Code (`200`)
        * Look for additional anomalies or correlations with other security events (e.g., failed logins, privilege escalations, or lateral movement attempts).

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If the log file shows repeated POST requests to '/cart/add' from `<SOURCE_IP>` with status code 200, and there are no corresponding security events, it could indicate a benign usage pattern.
    - ❌ If the log file shows frequent POST requests from `<SOURCE_IP>` with status code 200, and there are concurrent failed login attempts, privilege escalation attempts, or other suspicious activities involving the same user or IP, it suggests a possible attack attempt.
    - ❌ If the log file shows frequent POST requests from `<SOURCE_IP>` with status code 200, and there are no corresponding security events, it warrants further investigation into the nature of the traffic and potential impact.

**Additional Notes:**
*   Ensure that the log file path is accurate and accessible for analysis.
*   Consider correlating the log file with other security events, such as firewall logs, DNS logs, or Windows Security Events, to gain a more holistic view of the incident.
*   Pay attention to timestamps and sequence of events to identify any patterns or anomalies that could indicate malicious intent.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 8: Have similar patterns of POST requests been observed from other sources recently?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:**
*   **Objective:** Identify if there have been recent spikes in POST requests to '/cart/add' from other sources, potentially indicating coordinated bot activity.

*   **Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):**
    1.  **Web Access Logs (C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\u_ex240521.log):** Review recent entries for POST requests to '/cart/add'.
    2.  **SIEM (Splunk/Wazuh API):** Search for similar patterns of POST requests across multiple hosts or services.
    3.  **Threat Intelligence Platform (MISP):** Check for any known campaigns targeting '/cart/add' endpoints.

*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **Review Web Access Logs (Local File):**
        * Open the specified log file (C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\u_ex240521.log) and filter for POST requests to '/cart/add':
        ```bash
        # Using PowerShell
        Get-Content C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\u_ex240521.log | Select-String -Pattern "/cart/add" -CaseSensitive
        ```
        * Look for unusual spikes in requests around the same timeframe as the alert.

    2.  **SIEM/Splunk/Wazuh API (Remote Query):**
        * Splunk Query:
            ```splunk
            index="webserver_logs" sourcetype="access_combined" method="POST" uri="/cart/add" earliest=-24h@h latest=@h | stats count by clientip, uri | where count > 20
            ```
        * Wazuh API Query:
            ```http
            GET /agents/<AGENT_ID>/logs/summary?q=data.http.method:POST AND data.http.uri:/cart/add
            ```
        * Expected Output: A list of unique client IPs making POST requests to '/cart/add' over the last hour.

    3.  **Threat Intelligence Platform (MISP):**
        * MISP Query:
            ```python
            import pymisp
            
            misp = pymisp.MISP("localhost", 80, "admin", "password")
            event = misp.searchEvent(query="uri:/cart/add", type="attribute")
            print(event)
            ```
        * Expected Output: Any existing events or attributes mentioning '/cart/add' in MISP's threat intelligence feed.

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If similar POST request patterns are detected from other sources, it strengthens the case for coordinated bot activity.
    - ❌ If only the original source IP is seen, it suggests isolated behavior rather than a widespread campaign.
--------------------------------------------------

Question 9: Are there any additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with the source IP '198.51.100.25'?
Detailed Plan:
**Investigative Plan:**
*   **Objective:** Identify additional IOCs linked to <SOURCE_IP> through network traffic analysis, threat intelligence, and system logs.

*   **Key Data Sources/Tools (Prioritized):**
    1.  **Network Traffic Analysis (PCAPs or NetFlow):** Examine packet captures or flow records for unusual connections, ports, or protocols.
    2.  **Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs):** Cross-reference <SOURCE_IP> against known bad actor lists, malware C&C servers, or compromised hosts.
    3.  **System Logs (Windows Event Logs, Firewall Logs):** Look for login attempts, failed authentications, or other suspicious activities involving <SOURCE_IP>.

*   **Steps & Example Commands/Queries:**
    1.  **NetFlow Analysis (using Zeek/Argus or similar tool):**
        * Extract flows matching <SOURCE_IP>:
          `SELECT src_ip, dst_ip, proto, bytes, duration FROM netflow WHERE src_ip = '<SOURCE_IP>'`
        * Analyze top destination ports/services and identify anomalies.

    2.  **Threat Intelligence Platform (MISP or OpenCTI):**
        * Query MISP server for sightings or tags associated with <SOURCE_IP>:
          `curl -X 'POST''\
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          -d '{ "value": "<SOURCE_IP>", "type": "ip-src" }'`
        * Review results for known malicious tags, campaigns, or actors.

    3.  **Windows Event Log Analysis (Event Viewer or Sysmon Logs):**
        * Search for failed logins or account lockouts involving <SOURCE_IP>:
          `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security';ID=4625;Keywords=0x80000000000000} | Where-Object { $_.Message -match '<SOURCE_IP>' }`
        * Check for suspicious RDP or SMB connections:
          `Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer/Operational';ID=31013;Keywords=0x80000000000000} | Where-Object { $_.Message -match '<SOURCE_IP>' }`

*   **Expected Outcome/Interpretation:**
    - ✅ If <SOURCE_IP> shows up in multiple TIPs, recent PCAPs, or event logs with malicious indicators, it's likely tied to ongoing attacks.
    - ❌ If <SOURCE_IP> only appears in one isolated incident or isn't seen elsewhere, it might be a false positive or part of legitimate scanning.
