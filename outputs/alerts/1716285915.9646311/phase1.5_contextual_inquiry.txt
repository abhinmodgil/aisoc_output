--- Contextual Inquiry Output for Alert ID: 1716285915.9646311 ---
--- Associated Agent ID: ALU-003 ---

**Initial Alert Assessment and Dimensional Focus:**
This alert, identified by MITRE Technique T1014 (Rootkit), detects a possible kernel-level rootkit on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'. The key Cybersecurity Dimensions for initial investigation are: Process Behavior (to examine hidden processes), Host Vulnerability (kernel exploit assessment), User Attribution (to determine the affected user/group), and Contextual Dimension (to evaluate the criticality of the affected host).

**Critical Investigative Questions (Guided by MITRE Technique T1014 and Provided IOCs):**
1. What exactly is the rootkit hiding? Is it a process, file, or network connection?
2. How did the rootkit manage to hide itself from the /proc directory?
3. What is the parent process of the hidden process ('2508')?
4. Is there any indication of unauthorized code modification in the kernel space?
5. Have there been any recent updates or patches applied to 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'?
6. Are there any other alerts or anomalies associated with 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' around the same time?
7. Can we retrieve the full command history or system logs for the affected user/group?
8. Is there any evidence of lateral movement or compromise of other hosts within the aluskort-prod group?
9. What is the criticality rating of 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' in terms of data sensitivity and business operations?
