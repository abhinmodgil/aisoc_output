--- Contextual Inquiry Output for Alert ID: 1716285915.9646311 ---
--- Associated Agent ID: ALU-003 ---

**Initial Alert Assessment and Dimensional Focus:
**This alert, identified by MITRE Technique T1014 (Rootkit), signals possible kernel-level manipulation on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' through the 'rootcheck' decoder. T1014 often hides processes or files. Key Cybersecurity Dimensions include: Process Behavior (to detect hidden processes), Host Vulnerability (kernel integrity checks), User Attribution (if a user context exists), and Contextual Dimension (system criticality).

**Critical Investigative Questions (Guided by MITRE Technique T1014 and Provided IOCs):**
1. What exactly is the hidden process '2508'?
2. How does the 'rootcheck' decoder determine that '2508' is hidden?
3. Can we retrieve the hidden process '2508' using alternative methods?
4. Is the agent 'ALU-003' running on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' configured correctly for rootkit detection?
5. Have any other processes or files been altered or hidden on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'?
6. Is the group 'aluskort-prod' associated with sensitive operations on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'?
7. Are there any known vulnerabilities in the kernel version running on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'?
8. Has 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' recently undergone configuration changes or updates?
9. Are there additional alerts or logs indicating further compromise on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'?
