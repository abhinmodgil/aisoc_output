--- Contextual Inquiry Output for Alert ID: 1716285915.9646311 ---
--- Associated Agent ID: ALU-003 ---

**Initial Alert Assessment and Dimensional Focus:**
This alert, identified as Rule ID 521 ('Possible kernel level rootkit'), suggests a potential rootkit installation on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'. The MITRE Technique T1014 focuses on hiding processes, files, or network activity. Key Cybersecurity Dimensions include: Process Behavior (to assess the hidden process), Host Vulnerability (kernel integrity checks), User Attribution (if a user initiated the rootkit), and Contextual Dimension (criticality of the production server).

**Critical Investigative Questions (Guided by MITRE Technique T1014 and Provided IOCs):**
1. What process is being hidden from /proc?
2. How did the rootkit manage to hide itself from standard Linux monitoring tools?
3. Is the hidden process running under a legitimate user context or as root?
4. Does the host 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' have any known vulnerabilities that could allow kernel-level compromise?
5. Have other hosts in the environment shown similar alerts indicating rootkits?
6. What additional processes or services are running on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'?
7. Are there any indicators of lateral movement or further compromise after the rootkit installation?
8. Can we retrieve a memory dump or forensic image of 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' to analyze the hidden process?
9. Are there any security controls or endpoint protection solutions deployed that might detect or mitigate rootkits?
