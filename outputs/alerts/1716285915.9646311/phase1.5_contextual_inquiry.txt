--- Contextual Inquiry Output for Alert ID: 1716285915.9646311 ---
--- Associated Agent ID: ALU-003 ---

**Initial Alert Assessment and Dimensional Focus:**
This alert, identified by MITRE Technique T1014 (Rootkit), detects a potentially compromised system ('ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01') where a process ('2508') has been hidden from the standard Linux process listing (/proc). The key Cybersecurity Dimensions for initial investigation are: Process Behavior (to examine the hidden process), Host Vulnerability (assess kernel integrity), User Attribution (identify who ran the rootkit), and Contextual Dimension (understand the criticality of the affected system).

**Critical Investigative Questions (Guided by MITRE Technique T1014 and Provided IOCs):**
1. What is the full path and executable name of the hidden process '2508'?
2. How did the rootkit manage to hide the process '2508' from /proc?
3. What other processes or files have been altered or hidden by the rootkit?
4. Can you retrieve the hidden process '2508' through alternative methods like ps aux or lsof?
5. Is the agent hostname 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' running any outdated or vulnerable software?
6. Have any unauthorized users or services recently accessed 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'?
7. What logs or audit trails exist on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' that might indicate when the rootkit was installed?
8. Is there any evidence of lateral movement or additional compromise within the aluskort-prod group?
9. Should we isolate 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' immediately while further investigation continues?
