--- Contextual Inquiry Output for Alert ID: 1716285915.9646311 ---
--- Associated Agent ID: ALU-003 ---

**Initial Alert Assessment and Dimensional Focus:**
This alert, identified by MITRE Technique ID T1014 (Rootkit), indicates a possible kernel-level rootkit installation on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'. Given the nature of T1014, key Cybersecurity Dimensions include: Process Behavior (to detect unusual processes), Host Vulnerability (kernel exploit assessment), User Attribution (potential compromised users), Network Behavior (any anomalous traffic), IOC in Threat Intel (known rootkits), and Contextual Dimension (criticality of the affected asset).

**Critical Investigative Questions (Guided by MITRE Technique T1014 and Provided IOCs):**
1. What specific process ('2508') is being hidden from '/proc'?
2. How did the rootkit manage to install itself on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'?
3. Is there any indication of unauthorized user access preceding the rootkit installation?
4. Have other hosts in the 'aluskort-prod' group shown similar anomalies?
5. What kernel version is running on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'?
6. Are there any known CVEs affecting the kernel version that could facilitate rootkit installation?
7. What additional processes or services are running under the 'root' UID on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'?
8. Can we retrieve a memory dump or snapshot of 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' to analyze for rootkit indicators?
9. Are there any network connections originating from 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' that suggest C&C communication?
10. Has the rootkit modified any system binaries or files that could affect recovery?
