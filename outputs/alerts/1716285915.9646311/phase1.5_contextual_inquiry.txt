--- Associated Agent ID: ALU-003 ---

**Initial Alert Assessment and Dimensional Focus:
**This alert, identified by MITRE Technique T1014 (Rootkit), suggests a possible kernel-level rootkit installation on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'. The key Cybersecurity Dimensions for initial investigation are: Process Behavior (to examine hidden processes), Host Vulnerability (kernel integrity checks), User Attribution (to determine if 'ALU-003' is compromised), and Contextual Dimension (to evaluate the criticality of the affected system).

**Critical Investigative Questions (Guided by MITRE Technique T1014 and Provided IOCs):**
1. What exactly is the nature of the hidden process '2508'?
2. How did the process '2508' manage to hide itself from /proc?
3. Is the agent 'ALU-003' authorized to perform administrative actions on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'?
4. Have there been any recent changes or updates to the kernel or operating system on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'?
5. Are there any other indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with the group 'aluskort-prod' beyond the hidden process?
6. What is the criticality and business function of the host 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'?
7. Has the agent 'ALU-003' exhibited unusual or unauthorized behavior recently?
8. Are there any additional logs or alerts indicating further suspicious activities on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'?
9. Could the rootkit have been introduced through a software update or third-party package?
