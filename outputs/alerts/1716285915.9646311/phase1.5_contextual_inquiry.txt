--- Contextual Inquiry Output for Alert ID: 1716285915.9646311 ---
--- Associated Agent ID: ALU-003 ---

**Initial Alert Assessment and Dimensional Focus:**
This alert, identified by MITRE Technique T1014 (Rootkit), indicates a possible kernel-level rootkit installation on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'. The key Cybersecurity Dimensions for initial investigation are: Process Behavior (to analyze hidden processes), Host Vulnerability (potential kernel exploit), User Attribution (if a user context is involved), Network Behavior (any unusual outbound traffic), IOC in Threat Intel (known rootkits), and Contextual Dimension (asset importance and exposure).

**Critical Investigative Questions (Guided by MITRE Technique T1014 and Provided IOCs):**
1. What exactly is the hidden process '2508'?
2. How did the process '2508' get installed on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01'?
3. What is the parent process of '2508'?
4. Is the agent hostname 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' vulnerable to kernel exploits?
5. Have any other processes been hidden from /proc?
6. Is the group 'aluskort-prod' configured securely?
7. What is the criticality of the asset 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' within the organization?
8. Has the agent ID 'ALU-003' exhibited any anomalous behavior recently?
9. Are there any indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with known rootkits in threat intelligence sources?
