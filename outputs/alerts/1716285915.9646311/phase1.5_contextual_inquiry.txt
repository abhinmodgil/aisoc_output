--- Contextual Inquiry Output for Alert ID: 1716285915.9646311 ---
--- Associated Agent ID: ALU-003 ---

**Initial Alert Assessment and Dimensional Focus:**
This alert, identified as Rule ID 521 ("Possible kernel level rootkit"), suggests the presence of a rootkit on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' (MITRE Technique T1014). Given the nature of a rootkit, key Cybersecurity Dimensions include: Process Behavior (to examine hidden processes), Host Vulnerability (assessing OS/kernel integrity), User Attribution (identifying affected users), Network Behavior (checking for anomalies), IOC in Threat Intel (searching for known rootkit signatures), and Contextual Dimension (understanding the criticality of the affected asset).

**Critical Investigative Questions (Guided by MITRE Technique T1014 and Provided IOCs):**
1. What processes are currently running on 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' and their associated PIDs?
2. How does the process '2508' differ from others in terms of memory usage, CPU consumption, or parent-child relationships?
3. Is there any evidence of unauthorized code modifications or kernel hooks in the system logs (/var/log/messages)?
4. Have recent updates or patches been applied to 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' that could mitigate rootkit risks?
5. Can we retrieve a full memory dump of 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' for offline rootkit scanning tools?
6. Is 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' configured to run anti-rootkit scans regularly or upon detection triggers?
7. Are there any additional hosts within the group 'aluskort-prod' exhibiting similar rootkit alerts?
8. What is the criticality rating of 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' in terms of business operations and data sensitivity?
9. Have any unusual outbound connections been observed from 'ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01' since the alert?
