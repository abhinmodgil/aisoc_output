### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for a possible rootkit (T1014), which typically involves hiding malicious code at the kernel level. Since the alert includes a suspicious file path (/tmp/.X11-unix/Xrootkit), we should focus on understanding its origin and impact.
2.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Queries:** We need to confirm if the file exists, check its creation/modification time, and determine whether the associated process is still active. Additionally, searching for related files in the same directory could reveal additional artifacts.
3.  **Strategy for Wazuh Queries:** Given the nature of the alert, we should also investigate whether the host has been scanned for vulnerabilities recently and whether any related alerts have been triggered.
4.  **Strategy for Organization Database Queries:** Understanding the role of the affected host and its management history can provide valuable context for prioritizing remediation efforts.
