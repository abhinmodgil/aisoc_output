### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for a possible rootkit (T1014) on a support system. This is a high-risk situation requiring immediate investigation.
2.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Queries:** Since the alert involves suspicious files under `/tmp`, we must trace back how they got there. We'll start with the creation time of the file and work backward to identify the parent process. Additionally, we'll check for related files in the same directory or nearby locations.
3.  **Strategy for Wazuh Queries:** Given the nature of the alert, we should expand our search beyond just this one host. Checking for similar alerts across the organization can help us determine if this is an isolated incident or part of a larger campaign. We also want to know if the host has been compromised before, which might suggest a pattern of exploitation. Finally, running a port scan will give us insight into potential entry points used by attackers.
4.  **Strategy for Organization Database Queries:** Understanding who has access to the affected host is crucial. We need to know if there have been any recent permission changes or if new users have been added. Additionally, knowing the role of the host within the organization will help prioritize our response. If it's a critical asset, we may need to take more aggressive containment measures. Lastly, checking when the last security audit occurred will provide context about the state of the system at the time of the attack.
