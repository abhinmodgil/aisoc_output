### Executive Summary
A possible kernel-level rootkit was detected on a normal-criticality asset, but the investigation lacks sufficient context to make a definitive determination.

### Final Verdict
**Suspicious**

### Confidence
**Medium**

### Justification
The final risk score of 20 indicates a moderate level of concern. The "Contextual Guidance" score of 100 confirms that the asset is a virtual server hosting the support ticketing system, which is a critical application. However, the "Host Vulnerability" score of 0 means there is no evidence of existing vulnerabilities on the host, reducing the likelihood of exploitation. The "Process Behavior" score of 0 indicates a critical visibility gap regarding the behavior of the detected file '/tmp/.X11-unix/Xrootkit'. Without understanding what actions the rootkit may have taken, the true impact remains unclear. While the alert correctly triggered, the lack of additional context prevents a confident conclusion.

### Recommended Actions
- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a manual memory dump and deep inspection of the affected host to understand the scope of the rootkit's activities.
- **Containment:** Isolate the host from the network until the investigation is completed.
- **Patch Management:** Ensure the host is fully patched and up-to-date before returning it to service.
- **Alert Tuning:** Review the detection logic to ensure similar alerts trigger only when supported by strong contextual evidence.
