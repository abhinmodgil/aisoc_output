### Executive Summary
A possible rootkit installation was detected on a normal-criticality asset, but the investigation lacks sufficient context to confirm the severity.

### Final Verdict
**Suspicious**

### Confidence
**Medium**

### Justification
The final risk score of 27 indicates a moderate concern. The "Contextual Guidance" score of 100 means there is some relevant organizational knowledge about the asset, but the other dimensions—particularly "Host Vulnerability" and "Process Behavior"—are missing key details. The presence of a rootkit detection is concerning, especially given the asset's role in support ticketing. However, without deeper insight into the specific vulnerabilities present and the behavior of the rootkit, it cannot be definitively classified as malicious. Further investigation is necessary before taking containment or eradication actions.

### Recommended Actions
- **Forensic Analysis:** Run a comprehensive memory dump and deep filesystem inspection on `ALU-SUPPORT-PROD-01`. Focus on identifying the rootkit's persistence mechanism and any associated files or processes.
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Check the asset's patch status and vulnerability exposure using tools like Nessus or OpenVAS. Confirm if any known exploits could enable the rootkit installation.
- **Behavior Monitoring:** Deploy additional monitoring agents to capture real-time process execution and network traffic on the affected host.
- **Containment (Conditional):** If the forensic analysis reveals active exploitation or lateral movement, consider isolating the host until remediation is completed.
