### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for a potential network sniffing attempt (T1040). The source IP is private but the destination is public, which raises suspicion.
2.  **Strategy for Wazuh Query:** Since we're looking at network behavior, a broader time window makes sense. We want to see if there were repeated attempts or related traffic.
3.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Query:** Firewall logs can provide more detailed insights into the nature of the connection. We'll focus on the specific host involved in the alert.
4.  **Strategy for MISP Queries:** Both IPs are key indicators. We should check their reputations and associations in MISP.
5.  **Strategy for Organization Database Query:** Understanding the role of the affected device (`ALU-FW-EDGE-01`) will help us assess risk and prioritize follow-up actions.
