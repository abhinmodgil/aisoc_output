### Executive Summary
A potentially malicious IP address was detected communicating with a sensitive internal asset, but the absence of contextual data limits our ability to assess the severity.

### Final Verdict
**Suspicious**

### Confidence
**Medium**

### Justification
The final risk score of 30 indicates a moderate level of concern. The "IOC in Threat Intel" score of 100 confirms the destination IP (`104.207.51.245`) is associated with malicious activity in MISP, suggesting it may be part of a command-and-control infrastructure. However, the "Network Behavior" score of 0 means we do not know if this communication represents a real attack or legitimate administrative activity. Additionally, the "Contextual Guidance" score of 0 indicates we have no organizational policies or historical data to help interpret this behavior. Given these conflicting signals, we cannot definitively classify this as either malicious or benign without additional investigation.

### Recommended Actions
- **Forensic Analysis:** Collect packet captures from `ALU-FW-EDGE-01` around the time of the alert to understand the nature of the communication.
- **Policy Review:** Determine whether the destination IP (`104.207.51.245`) should ever communicate with your internal assets.
- **Threat Hunting:** Search other logs for similar communications involving `104.207.51.245`.
- **Response Plan:** Develop a response plan for handling future alerts involving this IP or similar indicators.
