### Executive Summary
A removable storage device was connected to a non-production server, raising concerns about potential data exfiltration or unauthorized access.

### Final Verdict
**Suspicious**

### Confidence
**Medium**

### Justification
The final risk score of 29 indicates a moderate level of concern. While the "User Attribution" score of 100 confirms that the local administrator account was used, the "Process Behavior" dimension scored 0, meaning we have a critical visibility gap regarding what actions were taken once the device was mounted. The fact that the asset is classified as "Normal" reduces the severity somewhat, but the combination of unusual behavior and insufficient evidence warrants further investigation.

### Recommended Actions
- **Forensic Analysis:** Run live forensics on `ALU-BCK-PROD-01` to determine if any sensitive files were accessed or copied from the attached device.
- **Device Quarantine:** Temporarily disconnect the device from the network until the investigation is completed.
- **Policy Review:** Verify that the local admin account should be allowed to mount removable media on this specific server.
