### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for a suspicious removable media detection (T1092). Since it involves a backup server, this could indicate a targeted attack against sensitive data.
2.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Queries:** We need to understand the exact timing of the insertion and whether any processes interacted with the drive. A detailed process timeline will help identify malicious behavior.
3.  **Strategy for Wazuh Queries:** Given the nature of the alert, we should check if this host has been targeted before. Additionally, looking for related vulnerabilities can provide additional context.
4.  **Strategy for Organization Database Queries:** Knowing who has physical access to the server and its intended purpose will help us assess the risk level and potential motives behind the attack.
