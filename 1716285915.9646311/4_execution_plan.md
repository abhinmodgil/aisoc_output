### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for a possible rootkit (T1014), which could indicate a compromised system. Since the alert is triggered by a root-level check, it requires immediate attention.
2.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Queries:** Given the nature of the alert, we should focus on the affected process (`PID=2508`) and its environment. We'll start with basic process information and then move to handle/network analysis.
3.  **Strategy for Waziraptor Queries:** The agent has reported itself as vulnerable to recent Linux kernel exploits. We must confirm if patches have been applied. Additionally, searching for past alerts can help us determine if this is part of a recurring issue.
4.  **Strategy for Organization Database Queries:** Knowing the role of the affected host and who manages it will provide crucial context for our investigation. It may also help prioritize response efforts based on business impact.
