### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for a possible rootkit (T1014), which could indicate a compromised system. Since the alert is from a production environment, this requires immediate investigation.
2.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Queries:** Given the nature of the alert, we should focus on the affected process itself. We'll start with basic information about the process and then move to deeper analysis of its behavior.
3.  **Strategy for Wazuh Queries:** Since the alert involves a potential compromise of the operating system, we should check if there are any known vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel that might have been exploited. Additionally, running a rootkit detection module can help identify hidden threats.
4.  **Strategy for Organization Database Queries:** Understanding the role of the affected host and who has access to it will provide crucial context for our investigation.
