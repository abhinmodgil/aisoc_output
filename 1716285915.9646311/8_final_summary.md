### Executive Summary
A possible rootkit was detected on a high-criticality asset, but the lack of supporting evidence and contextual guidance weakens confidence in the detection.

### Final Verdict
**Suspicious**

### Confidence
**Low**

### Justification
The final risk score of 24 is relatively low, reflecting the limited certainty around this event. While the "Possible Kernel Level Rootkit" alert triggered, there is no clear indication of malicious behavior beyond the initial detection. The "Process Behavior" and "Host Vulnerability" dimensions both scored 0, meaning we have no concrete evidence of compromise. Additionally, the "Contextual Guidance" score of 100 provides conflicting information: the asset is classified as "High" criticality, yet the general search shows it is a virtual server running Linux in Azure, which typically would not require such deep kernel-level monitoring. This discrepancy raises questions about whether the alert is relevant given the environment. Overall, the lack of corroborating evidence and the unusual context make this event suspicious rather than definitively malicious.

### Recommended Actions
- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct manual live forensics on `ALU-ORDPROC-PROD-01` to verify if the rootkit is active and determine its scope.
- **Alert Review:** Evaluate the effectiveness of the "Possible Kernel Level Rootkit" rule and consider adjusting thresholds or disabling it if it generates too many false positives.
- **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement additional monitoring for unexpected kernel activity on similar assets.
