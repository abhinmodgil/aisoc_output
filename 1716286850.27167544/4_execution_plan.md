### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for repeated 400 errors from a public IP against a web server. This could indicate reconnaissance or exploitation attempts.
2.  **Strategy for MISP Query:** The source IP is the primary IOC. We should check if it has been flagged as malicious in MISP.
3.  **Strategy for Wazuh Query:** Since we're dealing with web traffic, we want to see if there were other requests from the same IP within a reasonable timeframe.
4.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Queries:** Web server logs can reveal more details about the nature of the requests. We'll focus on finding 404 responses specifically. For process behavior, we'll look for active processes during the alert time. Finally, for network activity, we'll filter by port 80/443 since those are typically used for web traffic.
5.  **Strategy for Organization Database Query:** Knowing the exact web server software and version is crucial for understanding potential vulnerabilities.
6.  **Strategy for Wazuh Query:** If the organization performs regular vulnerability scans, checking for recent findings related to web servers can provide additional context.
