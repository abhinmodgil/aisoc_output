### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for repeated 404 errors on a WordPress config backup file. This could indicate reconnaissance or exploitation attempts.
2.  **Strategy for MISP Query:** The source IP is suspicious. We should check if it has been flagged as malicious in MISP.
3.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Query:** Since we have a specific path involved (`/config/wp-config.php.bak`), we can search for processes accessing this file.
4.  **Strategy for Wazuh Query:** Given the nature of the alert, we should also check for vulnerability scans or other signs of probing behavior.
5.  **Strategy for Organization Database Queries:** We need to gather information about who owns the server, what software is installed, and whether any recent changes could explain the activity.
