### Executive Summary
Multiple 400-level errors were received from a single source IP attempting to access a sensitive configuration file, suggesting vulnerability scanning activity targeting a high-criticality asset.

### Final Verdict
**Suspicious**

### Confidence
**Medium**

### Justification
The final risk score of 55 indicates a moderate level of concern. While the "IOC in Threat Intel" score of 100 confirms the source IP is not a known threat actor, the "Host Vulnerability" score of 50 reveals a critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-12345) affecting the asset. The "Network Behavior" score of 0 and "Process Behavior" score of 0 indicate a critical visibility gap regarding whether the scan attempted exploitation. The high criticality of the asset combined with confirmed vulnerability scanning behavior makes this event suspicious and warrants further investigation.

### Recommended Actions
- **Forensic Analysis:** Run live forensics on `ALU-WEB-PROD-01` to determine if any exploitation attempts were made.
- **Patch Management:** Prioritize patching the identified CVE-2024-12345 on this asset and similar systems.
- **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement additional monitoring rules to detect future scans from the same source IP.
