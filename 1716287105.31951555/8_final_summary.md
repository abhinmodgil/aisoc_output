### Executive Summary
A local administrator account was modified on a development web server, but the change did not involve password reset or other sensitive modifications.

### Final Verdict
**Informational**

### Confidence
**Low**

### Justification
The final risk score of 14 indicates a low-risk event. While the "Account Manipulation" technique is concerning, the specific details reveal this is likely a routine administrative task rather than a security breach. The "User Attribution" score of 50 means we do not know if the modification was made by an authorized admin or an attacker, but the fact that the username was changed without changing the password suggests this is not a credential theft attempt. The asset criticality is low, and there is no indication of lateral movement or additional suspicious activity. Given these factors, this appears to be a legitimate administrative change.

### Recommended Actions
- **Audit Review:** Verify with the IT team whether this change was expected and approved.
- **Policy Check:** Ensure local admin accounts on development systems are properly documented and monitored.
