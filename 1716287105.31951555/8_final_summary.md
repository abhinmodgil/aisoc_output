### Executive Summary
A local administrator account was modified on a development web server, but the change was likely legitimate maintenance activity.

### Final Verdict
**Suspicious**

### Confidence
**Medium**

### Justification
The final risk score of 26 indicates a moderate level of concern. The "User Attribution" score of 50 suggests some uncertainty about whether the change was authorized. While the "Contextual Guidance" score of 100 confirms the asset is a development system, the lack of detailed logs means we cannot definitively prove the change was part of planned maintenance. The low criticality of the asset reduces the overall impact, but the fact that a privileged account was altered warrants further investigation.

### Recommended Actions
- **Validate Change:** Contact the asset owner (TEAM-ALU-ECOMM) to confirm if this modification was intentional and document their response.
- **Monitor Activity:** Enable enhanced logging on the affected system to capture future changes to the local admin group.
- **Review Policies:** Ensure proper separation of duties between developers and administrators on this type of asset.
