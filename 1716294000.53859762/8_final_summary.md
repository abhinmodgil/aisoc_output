### Executive Summary
Multiple failed authentication attempts were detected on a high-criticality web server, but the volume remains within normal operational parameters.

### Final Verdict
**Suspicious**

### Confidence
**Medium**

### Justification
The final risk score of 11 indicates a moderate level of concern. The "Uncategorized" score of 33 suggests some unusual behavior, but without specific details, it cannot be classified definitively. The "User Attribution" score of 50 indicates the target username ('alu-backupsvc$') is associated with a service account, which could explain the repeated failures. However, the "Contextual Guidance" score of 0 means there is no clear understanding of why these failures occurred. Given the high criticality of the asset and the fact that multiple failed logons were recorded, this warrants further investigation to ensure it isn't a precursor to a larger attack.

### Recommended Actions
- **Forensic Analysis:** Run a detailed forensic investigation on `ALU-WEB-PROD-01` to understand the root cause of the failed logons.
- **Authentication Review:** Examine the permissions and usage patterns of the 'alu-backupsvc$' account to verify if it needs to authenticate interactively.
- **Alert Tuning:** Adjust the detection rule to reduce noise by excluding expected background processes like scheduled tasks or legitimate backups.
