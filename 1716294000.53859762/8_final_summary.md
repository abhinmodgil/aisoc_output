### Executive Summary
Multiple failed logon attempts were detected targeting a high-criticality web server, but the volume remains low and the target user is a service account with limited permissions.

### Final Verdict
**Suspicious**

### Confidence
**Medium**

### Justification
The final risk score of 14 indicates a moderate level of concern. While the "Process Behavior" and "Host Vulnerability" dimensions scored 0, meaning there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, the "User Attribution" score of 50 raises some alarms. The fact that the target username is a service account ('alu-backupsvc$') designed for automated backups suggests this could be legitimate activity. However, the high criticality of the asset combined with multiple failed logons within a short timeframe warrants further investigation.

### Recommended Actions
- **Validate Legitimacy:** Check with the IT operations team if this is expected behavior for the 'alu-backupsvc$' account.
- **Monitor Activity:** Increase logging verbosity for the 'alu-backupsvc$' account to capture any future activity.
- **Restrict Access:** Ensure the 'alu-backupsvc$' account has minimal permissions necessary for its function.
