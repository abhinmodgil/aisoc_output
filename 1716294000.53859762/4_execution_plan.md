### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for brute-force attempts against a backup service account (`alu-backupsvc$`) on a production web server (`ALU-WEB-PROD-01`). This could indicate credential stuffing or password spraying.
2.  **Strategy for Wazuh Query:** Since the alert involves network behavior, we should focus on failed logons from the same IP (`88.88.88.88`) across the entire day. We also want to check if there were any successful logons during this timeframe.
3.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Query:** Given the nature of the alert, we should look at the broader context of failed logons from the same IP (`88.88.88.88`) on the target system (`ALU-WEB-PROD-01`).
4.  **Strategy for MISP Query:** The IP address (`88.88.88.88`) is internal, but it’s still worth checking if it has been flagged in MISP as malicious or related to known threats.
5.  **Strategy for Organization Database Queries:** We need to gather information about the backup service account (`alu-backupsvc$`) itself—whether it’s a service account or tied to a real user—and whether there have been any recent changes to its permissions or attributes. Additionally, understanding the role of the workstation (`ALU-BCK-PROD-01`) can provide valuable context.
6.  **Strategy for Contextual Guidance:** Finally, we should investigate any unusual activities involving the workstation (`ALU-BCK-PROD-01`) around the time of the alert to determine if there are any additional indicators of compromise.
