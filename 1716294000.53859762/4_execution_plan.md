### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for multiple failed logon attempts (T1110). It involves a backup service account ('alu-backupsvc$') on a production web server. This is a medium-priority, multi-host event.
2.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Queries:** Since we have the hostname and target username, we can start with a basic process tree analysis to identify the parent process of the failed logon attempt. We also want to check if there are any unusual processes running during the same timeframe.
3.  **Strategy for Wazuh Queries:** Given the nature of the alert, we should expand our search beyond the exact time of the event. Look for any recent vulnerability scans or critical findings related to Kerberos or SMB. Additionally, check for misconfigurations that might enable brute force attacks.
4.  **Strategy for Organization Database Queries:** We need to gather more information about the account itself—whether it’s a service account or tied to a real person—and whether there are any documented procedures for handling such events.
