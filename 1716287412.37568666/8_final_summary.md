### Executive Summary
A removable media device was connected to a high-criticality web server, raising concerns about potential data exfiltration or malware introduction.

### Final Verdict
**Suspicious**

### Confidence
**Medium**

### Justification
The final risk score of 25 indicates a moderate level of concern. While the "Contextual Guidance" score of 50 provides some insight into the asset's role, the "Host Vulnerability" and "Process Behavior" dimensions both scored 0, indicating a critical visibility gap. We do not know if the device was used for legitimate purposes or if it introduced malware. The high criticality of the asset and the unusual behavior warrant further investigation.

### Recommended Actions
- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a manual review of the logs on `ALU-WEB-PROD-01` to determine if any sensitive data was accessed or transferred during the connection.
- **Device Inspection:** Physically inspect the connected device to verify its integrity and ensure it wasn't tampered with.
- **Policy Review:** Evaluate the organization's policies around removable media usage and consider implementing stricter controls.
