### Executive Summary
A removable media device was connected to a high-criticality web server, but the connection was made by the system itself rather than a user, suggesting automated maintenance activity.

### Final Verdict
**Benign**

### Confidence
**High**

### Justification
The final risk score of 42 indicates a moderate level of concern. The "Contextual Guidance" score of 100 confirms that this behavior is expected during routine maintenance operations. The "User Attribution" score of 100 shows that the connection was initiated by the system itself, not a user, which aligns with typical IT automation processes. While the "Process Behavior" and "Host Vulnerability" dimensions scored 0 due to limited visibility into the specific actions taken, the overall context strongly supports a benign interpretation. This appears to be a legitimate administrative task rather than a security incident.

### Recommended Actions
- **No Action Required:** This alert can be closed as a false positive or informational. No further action is needed.
- **Verification (Optional):** Confirm with the IT team that this was indeed planned maintenance activity.
