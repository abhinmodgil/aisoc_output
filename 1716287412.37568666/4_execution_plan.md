### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for a suspicious USB device being recognized on a production web server. This could indicate a potential insider threat or a compromised host.
2.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Queries:** Since we're dealing with a potentially malicious USB insertion, we should focus on understanding the current state of the host. We'll start with a broad process listing to see what was running at the time of detection, then move to network activity to check if anything unusual happened.
3.  **Strategy for Wazuh Queries:** Given the nature of the alert, we want to know if this host has had similar issues in the past. We'll also check for any other alerts related to this host that might provide additional context.
4.  **Strategy for Organization Database Queries:** We need to gather information about who has access to this host and what software is running on it. This will help us determine whether the USB insertion was authorized or if there are any known vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
5.  **Strategy for Contextual Guidance Queries:** Finally, we want to understand the organizational context of this host. Knowing its role and whether it should normally recognize unknown devices will help us assess the severity of the situation.
