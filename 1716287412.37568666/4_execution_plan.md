### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for a newly detected external device (T1092), which could indicate an attempt at data exfiltration or lateral movement. Since the host is part of a production environment, this requires immediate investigation.
2.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Queries:** Given the broad nature of the technique, we should focus on both process activity and network behavior. Narrowing down the time frame to within 5 minutes of the alert will help us identify suspicious processes and connections.
3.  **Strategy for Wazuh Queries:** We need to check if the host has been recently scanned for vulnerabilities and whether there are any existing issues related to removable media handling. Additionally, reviewing recent Windows Event Logs can provide more context about the device connection.
4.  **Strategy for Organization Database Queries:** Understanding who has admin access to the host and whether they are aware of the alert is crucial. We also need to know the purpose of the host and whether itâ€™s supposed to allow external devices. Finally, checking for recent policy changes related to removable media can help determine if this is a legitimate action or a potential breach.
