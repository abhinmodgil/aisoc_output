### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for a potential DDoS attack (T1498), likely involving a bot targeting the e-commerce system. The attacker appears to have used a private IP, which could indicate internal reconnaissance or a compromised device.
2.  **Strategy for Wazuh Query:** Since we know the source IP (`198.51.100.25`) and destination IP (`88.88.88.88`), we can filter for POST requests specifically from that source within a reasonable time frame (e.g., 1 hour).
3.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Query:** We want to confirm if the POST request triggered a response (HTTP 200) and whether it was handled by the expected web server process. Additionally, we should check for any unusual child processes, network connections, or file changes initiated by the web server process.
4.  **Strategy for MISP Query:** Given the nature of the attack, we should verify if the source IP has been flagged as malicious in MISP. If it exists, we'll gather additional context such as related events, tags, and reputation scores.
