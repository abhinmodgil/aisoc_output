### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for a potential DoS attack (T1498), likely involving a bot targeting the `/cart/add` endpoint. Since it's internal, we should focus on identifying the source and impact across the environment.
2.  **Strategy for Wazuh Queries:** We need to confirm if this is part of a larger pattern. A broader time range (last 24 hours) will help us identify whether this is isolated or ongoing. Additionally, searching for related alerts can reveal additional context.
3.  **Strategy for MISP Query:** The source IP is suspicious. Checking MISP for known threats can provide valuable insights into its history and associations.
4.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Query:** Understanding the local context is crucial. Knowing which process initiated the request and whether there were concurrent activities can help determine intent and scope.
