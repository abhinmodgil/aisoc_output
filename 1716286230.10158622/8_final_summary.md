### Executive Summary
A denial-of-service attack was attempted against a high-criticality web application, but the attacker did not succeed due to rate-limiting controls.

### Final Verdict
**Suspicious**

### Confidence
**Medium**

### Justification
The final risk score of 36 indicates a moderate level of concern. While the "IOC in Threat Intel" score of 100 confirms the source IP is not a known threat actor, the "Network Behavior" score of 0 reveals a critical visibility gap regarding the actual impact of the attack. The "Process Behavior" score also scored 0, suggesting a lack of forensic data about the attackerâ€™s activities. Despite the failed attack, the high criticality of the target and the unusual volume of traffic warrant further investigation to understand the intent and capabilities of the attacker.

### Recommended Actions
- **Forensic Analysis:** Run live forensics on `ALU-WEB-PROD-01` to determine if any malicious payloads were delivered during the attack.
- **Rate-Limiting Review:** Verify that rate-limiting thresholds are set appropriately to detect and mitigate future attacks.
- **Alert Tuning:** Adjust the detection rule to reduce noise by excluding expected traffic patterns like legitimate shopping cart additions.
