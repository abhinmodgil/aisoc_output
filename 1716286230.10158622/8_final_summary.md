### Executive Summary
A large volume of POST requests to a critical e-commerce application endpoint may indicate a denial-of-service attack, though the lack of forensic data prevents a definitive conclusion.

### Final Verdict
**Suspicious**

### Confidence
**Medium**

### Justification
The final risk score of 36 indicates a moderate level of concern. The "IOC in Threat Intel" score of 100 confirms the source IP is not a known threat actor. However, the "Network Behavior" score of 0 means there is a critical visibility gap regarding whether these requests were legitimate traffic or part of an attack. The high criticality of the asset combined with the unusual request pattern warrants further investigation.

### Recommended Actions
- **Forensic Analysis:** Run live forensics on `ALU-WEB-PROD-01` to determine if the incoming POST requests were legitimate customer transactions or part of an automated attack.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting rules on the affected endpoint to protect against future attacks.
- **Alert Tuning:** Adjust the detection rule to trigger only when multiple unique users make similar requests within a short timeframe.
