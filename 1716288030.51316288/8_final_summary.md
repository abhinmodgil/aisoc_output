### Executive Summary
Multiple failed authentication attempts were detected from a single source IP targeting a non-production authentication service. While the volume is concerning, the lack of contextual guidance and user attribution limits our ability to assess intent.

### Final Verdict
**Suspicious**

### Confidence
**Medium**

### Justification
The final risk score of 45 indicates a moderate level of concern. The "IOC in Threat Intel" score of 100 confirms the source IP is not a known threat actor. However, the "Network Behavior" score of 0 means we have a critical visibility gap regarding whether these were legitimate requests or automated probing. The "User Attribution" score of 50 suggests some user may have been involved, but we don't know who or why. Without additional context, this remains a suspicious event requiring manual review.

### Recommended Actions
- **Manual Review:** Investigate the specific URLs targeted (`/oauth2/token`) to understand if they are part of normal operations or potentially vulnerable endpoints.
- **Enhanced Monitoring:** Temporarily increase logging levels on `ALU-AUTH-PROD-01` to capture detailed request headers and payloads.
- **Alert Tuning:** Adjust the detection rule to trigger only when multiple unique paths are accessed within a short time window.
