### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for brute force attempts against a web server (T1110). The source IP is internal, which complicates attribution but also means we have more visibility into the target system.
2.  **Strategy for Wazuh Queries:** Since the source IP is internal, we can leverage detailed network logs to track interactions between hosts. We'll focus on both inbound and outbound traffic to identify patterns.
3.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Query:** Web servers typically log extensive details about client requests. By filtering for POST requests and 401 responses, we can pinpoint potential brute forcing attempts.
4.  **Strategy for MISP Query:** Given the internal nature of the IP, it's unlikely to be widely shared in open threat feeds. However, checking MISP for related indicators could still provide valuable context.
5.  **Strategy for Organization Database Queries:** Knowing who owns the affected agent and whether they're authorized to perform certain actions will help us assess the legitimacy of the request. Additionally, understanding the purpose of the service being targeted can inform our analysis of the attack vector.
6.  **Strategy for Configuration Change Checks:** Recent updates to the web server may introduce new vulnerabilities or alter existing configurations. Checking for recent changes helps ensure we're investigating the current state of the environment.
