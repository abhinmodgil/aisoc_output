### Executive Summary
Multiple failed login attempts were made against a high-criticality web server using a valid domain account, but the source IP address is not associated with any known threats.

### Final Verdict
**Suspicious**

### Confidence
**Medium**

### Justification
The final risk score of 66 indicates a moderate level of concern. The "IOC in Threat Intel" score of 100 confirms the source IP is not a known threat actor. However, the "Network Behavior" score of 0 means there is a critical visibility gap regarding the volume and timing of these failed logons. The high criticality of the asset combined with multiple failed authentication attempts targeting a valid domain account raises suspicions about whether this is simply opportunistic scanning or a targeted attack. Further investigation is needed to determine if this is a legitimate threat or a false positive.

### Recommended Actions
- **Forensic Analysis:** Run live forensics on `ALU-WEB-PROD-01` to determine the number of failed logon attempts over time and correlate them with other events.
- **Source IP Monitoring:** Add the source IP (`203.0.113.75`) to a temporary allowlist and monitor for additional failed logons.
- **Policy Review:** Evaluate the need for stricter lockout policies on production systems.
