### Executive Summary
Multiple failed login attempts were detected targeting a high-criticality web server, originating from an unknown external IP address. While the source IP is not flagged as malicious, the volume and timing suggest a potential brute force attack.

### Final Verdict
**Suspicious**

### Confidence
**Medium**

### Justification
The final risk score of 47 indicates a moderate level of concern. The "IOC in Threat Intel" score of 100 confirms the source IP is not a known threat actor, reducing the likelihood of a targeted attack. However, the "Network Behavior" score of 0 highlights a critical visibility gapâ€”there is no evidence of the attacker stopping their activity after the initial detection. Additionally, the "User Attribution" score of 50 reveals that the target user 'diana.gomez' is a valid employee, increasing the potential impact if compromised. The combination of these factors warrants further investigation before concluding whether this is a true threat or a false positive.

### Recommended Actions
- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a manual review of the affected system (`ALU-WEB-PROD-01`) to determine if there are signs of lateral movement or other malicious activities beyond the initial failed logins.
- **Account Review:** Verify that the user 'diana.gomez' still requires access to the web server and ensure their credentials are strong and rotated regularly.
- **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement additional logging and monitoring rules to capture detailed authentication events on this server, focusing on failed logins and unusual patterns.
