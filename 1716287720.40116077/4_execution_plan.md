### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for brute force attempts against a user ('diana.gomez') on a production web server ('ALU-WEB-PROD-01'). This is a medium-severity, multi-stage attack.
2.  **Strategy for Wazuh Query:** Since the attacker is attempting to connect repeatedly, we should focus on network behavior rather than individual login failures. A wide time window (â‰¥1 hour) will help us identify potential reconnaissance or follow-up actions.
3.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Query:** Firewall logs can reveal if the attacker was actively trying to gain access through the perimeter defenses. We want to check both allowed and denied connections to see if the attacker was probing different ports or protocols.
4.  **Strategy for MISP Query:** The attacker's IP (`203.0.113.75`) is a key IOC. We should perform a comprehensive MISP search to gather as much information about it as possible.
5.  **Strategy for Organization Database Queries:** The target user ('diana.gomez') and the affected host ('ALU-WEB-PROD-01') are both internal assets. We need to retrieve detailed information about them from our internal database.
