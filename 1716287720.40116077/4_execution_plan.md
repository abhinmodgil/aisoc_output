### Reasoning Monologue

1.  **Overall Analysis:** The alert is for brute-force attacks (T1110) targeting a production web server. The attacker appears to be attempting to access the account of a legitimate user (`diana.gomez`).
2.  **Strategy for Wazuh Queries:** Given the nature of the attack, it’s important to investigate both the network behavior and the local system context. We’ll start with network-based reconnaissance to identify additional failed logon attempts, then pivot to the local system to gather more detailed information about the target user and potential lateral movement.
3.  **Strategy for Velociraptor Query:** Since we have identified a suspicious IP address (`203.0.113.75`) involved in the attack, we will focus our investigation on the target host (`ALU-WEB-PROD-01`) to determine if there are any related events in the event logs.
4.  **Strategy for MISP Query:** Given the presence of the IP address as an IOC, we will perform a lookup in MISP to retrieve additional contextual information about the IP address, such as its reputation, associated tags, and any known malicious activities linked to it.
5.  **Strategy for Organization Database Queries:** Since the target user (`diana.gomez`) is part of the organization, we will leverage internal databases to gather more information about the user, including their ownership, role, and any recent changes to their account.
